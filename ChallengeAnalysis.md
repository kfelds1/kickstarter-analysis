# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

    Louise is hoping to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her new play, *Fever* but she wants to know if her expectations for the success of her play are realistic. She is looking for more information on what types of variables impact the outcome of a campaign, so I analyzed data from thousands of crowdfunding campaigns across all varieties, including theatre, technology, film, and more.

### Purpose
    
    The purpose of this specific analysis is to explore the outcomes of a campaign based on launch date as well as goal funding. Is there a certain time of year to launch a campaign to ensure that it will be successful? Is there a relationship between the amount of goal funding and the outcome of the campaign?

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
