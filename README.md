# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

    Louise is hoping to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her new play, *Fever* but she wants to know if her expectations for the success of her play are realistic. She is looking for more information on what types of variables impact the outcome of a campaign, so I analyzed data from thousands of crowdfunding campaigns across all varieties, including theatre, technology, film, and more.

### Purpose
    
    The purpose of this specific analysis is to explore the outcomes of a campaign based on launch date as well as goal funding. Is there a certain time of year to launch a campaign to ensure that it will be successful? Is there a relationship between the amount of goal funding and the outcome of the campaign?

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    To determine if there is any correlation between the success of a campaign and the time of year that it is released, I created a Pivot Table that would clearly show the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each month of the year. This Pivot Table had two filters, one being the Parent Category and the other being the year that the campaign was released. Since Louise is interested in funding her play, the Pivot Table could be filtered for the Theatre category only.

By simply looking at the numbers, there is an evident increase in successful campaigns in the months of May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
